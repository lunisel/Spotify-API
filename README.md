The final goal of this project was to make the visual of 4 Spotify pages:

- Login page
- Home page
- Artist page
- Album page

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- Bootstrap

## Launch

To launch the web-site go to https://radensuaso.github.io/spotify-clone/ and type the following e-mail and password:

- **E-mail:** power-rangers@strive.com
- **Password:** bestteamever

Then once you are on the home page, there are two links in the footer beside the album picture "Bohemian Rhapsody" and "Queen". With these you can go between the two pages.

There is a link on the side Navbar "Home" that goes back to the Homepage.

Enjoy!
